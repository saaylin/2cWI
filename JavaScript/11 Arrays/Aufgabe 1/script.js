/* the programm the nucleorÂ´tides inside a DNA sequence can
be represented by a string composed by A, C, G and T. 
A sample string representing a DNA sequence is "ATGCTTCAGAAAAGGTCAGCG":

Your Task is to count how many times the symbols A,C, G and T appear in the strings.

Input: A single line, composed of A,C,G and T.
Output: The number of times A, C,G and T appear in the strings, seperated by a space 
Constraints: 0<len(s)<100
example: Input AACT
        Output 2 1 0 1
